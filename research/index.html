				  <blockquote>The COVID-19 pandemic increased the risk of travelling, working, and participating in public events. To test whether there were gendered differences in the response to COVID-19, we examine the behavior of male and female professional tennis players. We use data from major tennis tournaments which included a rather large number of athletes withdrawing from play. After controlling for past performance, wealth, and other relevant player attributes, we find that female tennis players were more likely to withdraw. This suggests that high-earning women may have greater risk aversion, especially related to COVID-19, than their male counterparts. Importantly, women were more risk-averse when it comes to international travel.</blockquote>

				  <blockquote>Recent research in cryptocurrencies has considered the effects of the behavior of individuals on the price of cryptocurrencies through actions such as social media usage. However, some celebrities have gone as far as affixing their celebrity to a specific cryptocurrency, becoming a crypto-tastemaker. One such example occurred in April 2021 when Elon Musk claimed via Twitter that ``SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon". He later called himself the ``Dogefather" as he announced that he would be hosting Saturday Night Live (SNL) on May 8, 2021. By performing sentiment analysis on relevant tweets during the time he was hosting SNL, evidence is found that negative perceptions of Musk's performance led to a decline in the price of Dogecoin, which dropped 23.4% during the time Musk was on air. This shows that cryptocurrencies are affected in real time by the behaviors of crypto-tastemakers.</blockquote>

				  <blockquote>This paper is a replication and extension of Buitenzorgy and Mol (2011). We recreate the data and analyses from that paper on the impact of democracy on deforestation from 1990 through 2000 with great precision before extending the data set and analyses to include the period from 2000 through 2010. We find that the original results of Buitenzorgy and Mol (2011) were spurious and inconsistent in the replication once heteroskedasticity robust standard errors were employed. When combining the two time periods and running analyses on panel data and differenced data for robust outcomes and better policy inferences, we find different results for the effect of democracy on deforestation, indicating that model specification is critical to studying this relationship. The more econometrically sound method, the differenced models, reject the Environmental Kuznet's Curve (EKC) hypothesis for democracy and deforestation, instead indicating that democracy decreased deforestation rates. When adding democracy spillover effects to the model, i.e., the impact on deforestation rates due to changes in democracy levels in neighboring countries, we still find that democracy leads to decreased rates of deforestation. We also find that having more democratic neighbors leads to further decreases in democracy. These outcomes have far-reaching implications for the blocs examined, which are highlighted in this study.</blockquote>

Science of The Total Environment, 713, 136531.</li>
				  <blockquote>The 45th presidential administration declared natural gas to be “molecules of freedom”, a perfunctory used for political gain. Additionally, this administration has also levied tariffs as a political tool designed to reduce trade deficits rather than promote sustainability. In this paper, we study the impact of tariffs on domestic carbon intensities and carbon dioxide emissions. We find that tariffs increase carbon intensities and do not have an effect on carbon dioxide emissions. Since tariffs also reduce output, we conclude that by implementing tariffs the second best problem is invoked and overall market inefficiency increases. Additionally, since carbon intensities rise and overall carbon dioxide emissions do not decline, regional concerns over environmental quality and health should be raised. The paper concludes with a discussion of how these results impact policy decisions pertaining to instruments for promoting sustainability.</blockquote>

				  <blockquote>Alley cropping is an agroforestry system in which annual crops are grown in alleys between rows of woody perennials for timber or other products, which can provide ecosystem services and help farmers diversify outputs. But is alley cropping a financially viable alternative to monocropping? To answer this question, a Monte Carlo model of financial risk and returns was used to understand how this diversification of outputs might help farmers in the southeast United States adapt to future scenarios in which agriculture or forestry may become more risky due to a changing climate or other factors. Traditional monocropping had the highest mean returns in the base scenario (based on current risk conditions), but the highest risk. Pine plantations had the lowest returns and lowest risk, and alley cropping was intermediate (mean soil expectation values of $5513 for monocropping, $3955 for alley cropping, and $2693 for pine plantations). The model results showed that traditional monocropping does not stochastically dominate alley cropping in any of the risk scenarios, meaning that alley cropping may have a place for risk-averse farmers. Furthermore, in the scenario in which the downside risk of annual crop production is increased – perhaps due to increased frequency of floods, droughts, etc. – alley cropping mean returns are higher and risk lower than traditional monocropping (mean soil expectation values of $2951 and $2911, respectively, and pine plantations at $2688), meaning any risk averse farmer might prefer alley cropping to monocropping.</blockquote>

				  <blockquote>Analyses of the Environmental Kuznet’s Curve (EKC) hypothesis have largely focused on economy level data with occasional analyses exploring sector level data. This paper exploits a new data set which contains sector level data on greenhouse gas emissions from the US energy sector as well as subsector data from six disjoint subsectors which together comprise the entire energy sector. The data contained in this data set is annual data at the state level from 1990 through 2011. Using differenced data, we specify an econometrically sound EKC model and compare it against a model containing only a linear GDP per capita term. We find that using a subsector level modeling approach, evidence for the EKC hypothesis is virtually nonexistent. Moreover, we find that aggregated subsector level estimates outperform sector-level estimate on in-sample accuracy. These estimated models are then used to forecast emissions for the energy sector. We find evidence that US greenhouse gas emissions from energy production are at or near a peak.</blockquote>

				  <li>Air Pollution and Physical Productivity: Evidence From Ultramarathons (with Heather Stephens)</li>
				  <blockquote>Air pollution is known to lower worker productivity in myriad settings. However, causal inference studies with reliable air pollution data studying the effect of air pollution on physical productivity in outdoor settings over periods of time comparable to a workday are sparse. Furthermore, identification of the specific pollutant(s) responsible for this effect is even less common. By using ultramarathon race performances as a measure of physical productivity and spatiotemporal variation in ambient pollution levels, it is determined that particulate matter (PM10) is the key pollutant responsible for decreasing consistent, metered physical productivity in outdoor settings, with a 1% increase in ambient levels of particulate matter leading to a 0.071% decrease in physical productivity as measured by ultramarathon race performance. In addition to this, this paper also extends the existing literature by suggesting a distinction in which pollutants affect physical productivity along an aerobic/anaerobic divide, thereby explaining part of the existing ozone-particulate matter divide in the air pollution and physical productivity literature, as well as by providing the first evidence of gender based differences in the effects of air pollution on physical productivity.</blockquote>
				  
				  <li>Economic, Environmental, and Technical Gains from the Kyoto Protocol: Evidence from Cement Manufacturing (with Heather Stephens)</li>
				  <blockquote>In order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and mitigate the consequences of global climate change, in 1997, an international agreement, the Kyoto Protocol was signed. Early studies have attributed approximately a 7-10% reduction in global carbon dioxide emissions to the Kyoto Protocol. Given the historically stagnant carbon intensity of cement manufacturing, it is likely that cement production would have contributed to this decline. However, reductions in carbon dioxide emissions in cement manufacturing require either a costly new emissions abatement strategy or a reduction in production. We examine the impact of the Kyoto Protocol on cement manufacturing output and carbon dioxide emissions. We find that nations with binding emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol saw about a 5% reduction in cement manufacturing and carbon dioxide emissions from cement manufacturing compared to other nations. Based on the relative magnitude of these effects, the Kyoto Protocol may have led to technological innovation in cement manufacturing. Using data on carbon intensities for cement manufacturing, we support this notion and find further evidence that it fostered technical innovation and diffusion from relatively more developed nations. We do not find evidence that any of this reduction in carbon dioxide emissions was offset by a carbon leakage effect. Using estimates of the social cost of carbon from the economics literature and the results from this paper, back of the envelope calculations suggest that the Kyoto Protocol had an economic gain of $7.4 billion from the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from cement manufacturing alone.</blockquote>
				  
				  <li>Gender, Risk Aversion, and Travel: How COVID-19 Affected Participation in Ultramarathons (with Heather Stephens)</li>
                		  <blockquote>Many running events have been cancelled during the COVID-19 era, yet many others have continued. By using a novel data set containing information on ultramarathon races (long distance or long time races comprising a popular form of outdoor recreation) and their participants, we study the decision to compete in a race during the COVID-19 era. By restricting our analysis to those runners who participated in the pre-COVID-19 version of a race and observing whether or not they attended that same event during the COVID-19 era (or if they attended another ultramarathon within ± 1 month of the expected event date for cancelled events) we are able to estimate the impact of local and race destination COVID-19 cases on the decision to compete. We find that local COVID-19 cases, along with a series of expected socioeconomic factors including runner ability, runner experience, travel distance, education level, and gender all affect the decision to compete in a COVID-19 era ultramarathon. We also find that events were more likely to be cancelled when COVID-19 cases rose in the state in which the race is located. Women were also disproportionately affected by the pandemic when it comes to changes in travel behavior.</blockquote>
