				  <blockquote>The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement signed in 1997 to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and mitigate the consequences of global climate change. Early studies of the effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol have attributed it to approximately a 7%–10% reduction in global carbon dioxide emissions. Given the carbon intensity of cement manufacturing, we examine the impact of the Kyoto Protocol on cement manufacturing output and carbon dioxide emissions. We are especially concerned about whether the Kyoto Protocol may have led cement manufacturing to move to places without binding emissions targets, thus resulting in carbon leakage. We find that nations with binding emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol saw a 5% reduction in both cement manufacturing and carbon dioxide emissions from cement manufacturing compared to other nations, suggesting that the Kyoto Protocol may have led to technological innovation in cement manufacturing. Using data on carbon intensities for cement manufacturing, we support this notion and find further evidence that it fostered diffusion of existing, cleaner technologies from relatively more developed nations during the first phase, and technical innovation by these nations during the second phase, resulting in significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.</blockquote>

				  <blockquote>Climate policy affects the economy. Economists typically consider the economic costs associated with climate policy, but not all economic consequences of climate policy are necessarily negative. This paper considers the impact of the Kyoto Protocol on the international trade network for timber products and the competition graph derived therefrom. Implementing an instrumental variables difference-in-differences approach which uses a panel of centrality and clustering measures describing the relative importance of individual nations in the international trade network for timber products, this paper finds that nations that set a binding emissions target under the Kyoto Protocol saw the centrality of their position within this network decrease. Since the nations which set binding emissions targets were also the wealthiest nations, an additional consequence is that less wealthy economies became relative more important members of this international trade network. This is likely due to nations with a binding emissions target placing an increased importance on forested land for carbon sequestration. These results are extended to the competition graph of the international trade network for timber products where it is found that nations with binding emissions targets became marginally less important. However, increased clustering among nations with binding emissions targets in the competition graph occurred as a consequence of the Kyoto Protocol. Collectively, these results indicate that the competitive playing field was leveled in the international timber trade network while helping make progress towards multiple economically and environmentally oriented United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</blockquote>

				  <blockquote>Core-periphery models are a commonly used and powerful tool in network analysis which allow researchers to identify a set of highly influential members (the core) based on the structure of the network. However, there is no standard method for core identification. Worse yet, for researchers in fields such as economics, existing methods often do not allow for researchers to make meaningful inferences from core-periphery analyses. This paper introduces a new method using integer programming to identify the core of a weighted network with either symmetric or asymmetric relationships and without the aid of any a priori assumptions. The integer program maximizes the weighted influence of the members of the core while imposing a set of user-parameterized connectivity constraints, both within the core and between the core and the periphery. As a result, this model generalizes previous concepts of the core of a network, i.e., an idealized core, through the flexibility created by the two connectivity parameters. These parameters give researchers the freedom to apply discipline specific theory to core-periphery analyses. This approach also offers drastically improved handling of directed data compared to existing methods of core-periphery analysis. An algorithm which converts the initially non-linear integer program into a linear integer programming approach is presented, and several examples are studied using this method to demonstrate its efficacy including a data set of international collaborations in academic publications and a data set of US railway shipments.</blockquote>

				  <blockquote>The COVID-19 pandemic increased the risk of travelling, working, and participating in public events. To test whether there were gendered differences in the response to COVID-19, we examine the behavior of male and female professional tennis players. We use data from major tennis tournaments which included a rather large number of athletes withdrawing from play. After controlling for past performance, wealth, and other relevant player attributes, we find that female tennis players were more likely to withdraw. This suggests that high-earning women may have greater risk aversion, especially related to COVID-19, than their male counterparts. Importantly, women were more risk-averse when it comes to international travel.</blockquote>

The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, 35(3), 475-484.</li>
				  <blockquote>Introduction: The use of telemedicine increased during the global Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Rural populations often struggle with adequate access to care while simultaneously experiencing multiple health disparities. Yet, telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic has been understudied on its effect on visit completion in rural populations. The primary purpose of this study is to understand how telemedicine delivery of family medicine care affects patient access and visit completion rates in a rural primary care setting. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study on primary care patient visits at an academic family medicine clinic that serves a largely rural population. We gathered patient demographic and visit type and completion data on all patients seen in the West Virginia University Department of Family Medicine between January 2019 and November 2020. Results: The final sample included 110,999 patient visits, including 13,013 telemedicine visit types. Our results show that telemedicine can increase completion rates by about 20% among a sample of all ages and a sample of adults only. Working-aged persons are more likely to complete telemedicine visits. Older persons with higher risk scores are more likely to complete their visits if they use telemedicine. Conclusions: Telemedicine can be a tool to improve patient access to primary care in rural populations. Our findings suggest that telemedicine may facilitate access to care for difficult-to-reach patients, such as those in rural areas, as well as those who have rigid work schedules, live longer distances from the clinic, have complex health problems, and are from areas of higher poverty and/or lower education.</blockquote>

				  <blockquote>Recent research in cryptocurrencies has considered the effects of the behavior of individuals on the price of cryptocurrencies through actions such as social media usage. However, some celebrities have gone as far as affixing their celebrity to a specific cryptocurrency, becoming a crypto-tastemaker. One such example occurred in April 2021 when Elon Musk claimed via Twitter that ``SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon". He later called himself the ``Dogefather" as he announced that he would be hosting Saturday Night Live (SNL) on May 8, 2021. By performing sentiment analysis on relevant tweets during the time he was hosting SNL, evidence is found that negative perceptions of Musk's performance led to a decline in the price of Dogecoin, which dropped 23.4% during the time Musk was on air. This shows that cryptocurrencies are affected in real time by the behaviors of crypto-tastemakers.</blockquote>

				  <blockquote>Alley cropping is an agroforestry system in which annual crops are grown in alleys between rows of woody perennials for timber or other products, which can provide ecosystem services and help farmers diversify outputs. But is alley cropping a financially viable alternative to monocropping? To answer this question, a Monte Carlo model of financial risk and returns was used to understand how this diversification of outputs might help farmers in the southeast United States adapt to future scenarios in which agriculture or forestry may become more risky due to a changing climate or other factors. Traditional monocropping had the highest mean returns in the base scenario (based on current risk conditions), but the highest risk. Pine plantations had the lowest returns and lowest risk, and alley cropping was intermediate (mean soil expectation values of $5513 for monocropping, $3955 for alley cropping, and $2693 for pine plantations). The model results showed that traditional monocropping does not stochastically dominate alley cropping in any of the risk scenarios, meaning that alley cropping may have a place for risk-averse farmers. Furthermore, in the scenario in which the downside risk of annual crop production is increased – perhaps due to increased frequency of floods, droughts, etc. – alley cropping mean returns are higher and risk lower than traditional monocropping (mean soil expectation values of $2951 and $2911, respectively, and pine plantations at $2688), meaning any risk averse farmer might prefer alley cropping to monocropping.</blockquote>

				  <blockquote>We introduce the cycle intersection graph of a graph, an adaptation of the cycle graph of a graph, and use the structure of these graphs to prove an upper bound for the decycling number of all even graphs. This bound is shown to be significantly better when an even graph admits a cycle decomposition in which any two cycles intersect in at most one vertex. Links between the cycle rank of the cycle intersection graph of an even graph and the decycling number of the even graph itself are found. The problem of choosing an ideal cycle decomposition is addressed and is presented as an optimization problem over the space of cycle decompositions of even graphs, and we conjecture that the upper bound for the decycling number of even graphs presented in this paper is best possible.</blockquote>

				  <li>Time Zones, Productivity, and Discontinuities in the Spatial (Dis)Equilibrium</li></li>
				  <blockquote>Time zones represent an unexplored discontinuity in spatial equilibrium models in the form of increased barriers to the amenities that come with agglomeration economies. In this paper I show that sorting along time zone boundaries is not in equilibrium, and that productivity gains are possible in counties on the ``wrong'' side of the boundary in certain cases. To accomplish this, I first exploit the change of Mercer County, North Dakota from Mountain Time to Central Time to show that there were gains in physical productivity among participants in the Bismarck Marathon and Half-Marathon using a difference-in-differences framework. I then build on this result by applying the same framework to industry-level job count data and find that changing time zones caused an increase in job creation in Mercer County. I then provide direct evidence of a spatial disequilibrium around time zone boundaries by estimating the effect of being on the ``good'' side of a time zone boundary on total migration inflows as well as net migration within metro areas in four metro areas near the boundary between Eastern Time and Central Time. I find that people prefer to move to the ``good'' side of the boundary in both scenarios. Collectively these results imply that counties on the ``bad'' side of a time zone boundary stand to make significant economic gains by moving to the ``good'' side of the time zone boundary, and that people are actively leaving counties on the ``bad'' side for counties on the ``good'' side. Finally, to motivate the idea that time zones affecting sleep is a mechanism for these effects, I develop a model of sleep and productivity with a time zone effect. Solving the model shows that workers on the ``bad'' side of the boundary get less sleep, are less productive, and, consequentially, pay less in rent. This model prediction is empirically verified by a regression using median rent data from the American Community Survey.</blockquote>
				  				  
				  <li>Road Network Structure and Air Pollution: Moving Beyond the Fundamental Law of Road Congestion (with Heather Stephens)</li>
				  <blockquote>Transportation is one of the primary contributors to local pollution stocks and flows. This paper considers how the structure of local road networks and the accompanying vehicular emissions might affect pollution stocks and flows. A pollution stock and flow model building on the Fundamental Law of Road Congestion that considers the impact of road network structure is presented and used to generate hypotheses for how the structure of road networks should affect pollution stocks and flows. The main avenues for these effects are via traffic congestion and the opportunity cost of driving. Using topological indices to describe the structure of road networks, these hypotheses are tested using a Hausman-Taylor approach using a measure of urban form as an instrument to address the endogeneity of the network structure. Evidence is found supporting the hypotheses that better connected road networks, i.e., those with fewer bottlenecks and which generally allow for more efficient traversal, lead to lower levels of pollution stocks and flows. Evidence is also found that drivers adapt to more circuitous road networks with lower levels of driving. These mechanisms are confirmed by regressing measures of congestion and the opportunity cost of driving against the topological indices.</blockquote>
				  				  
				  <li>Air Pollution and Physical Productivity: Evidence From Ultramarathons (with Heather Stephens)</li>
				  <blockquote>Air pollution is known to lower worker productivity in myriad settings. However, causal inference studies with reliable air pollution data studying the effect of air pollution on physical productivity in outdoor settings over periods of time comparable to a workday are sparse. Furthermore, identification of the specific pollutant(s) responsible for this effect is even less common. By using ultramarathon race performances as a measure of physical productivity and spatiotemporal variation in ambient pollution levels, it is determined that particulate matter (PM10) is the key pollutant responsible for decreasing consistent, metered physical productivity in outdoor settings, with a 1% increase in ambient levels of particulate matter leading to a 0.071% decrease in physical productivity as measured by ultramarathon race performance. In addition to this, this paper also extends the existing literature by suggesting a distinction in which pollutants affect physical productivity along an aerobic/anaerobic divide, thereby explaining part of the existing ozone-particulate matter divide in the air pollution and physical productivity literature, as well as by providing the first evidence of gender based differences in the effects of air pollution on physical productivity.</blockquote>
				  
				  <li>Gender, Risk Aversion, and Travel: How COVID-19 Affected Participation in Ultramarathons (with Heather Stephens)</li>
                		  <blockquote>Many running events have been cancelled during the COVID-19 era, yet many others have continued. By using a novel data set containing information on ultramarathon races (long distance or long time races comprising a popular form of outdoor recreation) and their participants, we study the decision to compete in a race during the COVID-19 era. By restricting our analysis to those runners who participated in the pre-COVID-19 version of a race and observing whether or not they attended that same event during the COVID-19 era (or if they attended another ultramarathon within ± 1 month of the expected event date for cancelled events) we are able to estimate the impact of local and race destination COVID-19 cases on the decision to compete. We find that local COVID-19 cases, along with a series of expected socioeconomic factors including runner ability, runner experience, travel distance, education level, and gender all affect the decision to compete in a COVID-19 era ultramarathon. We also find that events were more likely to be cancelled when COVID-19 cases rose in the state in which the race is located. Women were also disproportionately affected by the pandemic when it comes to changes in travel behavior.</blockquote>
				  
				  <li>The Golden Ticket: Examining the Impact of Winning the Western States Endurance Run Lottery on Subsequent Ultramarathon Performance and Travel Decisions (with Evan Bennett)</li>
				  <blockquote>The Western States Endurance Run (WSER) is the premier 100 mile trail race in the United States. Due to requirements put in place by the United States Forest Service, there are only a limited number of participants allowed to compete in any given year. These participants are selected through a lottery for which they must first qualify by running a qualifying performance at another event. For these reasons, the WSER is a “bucket list” event for many ultramarathon runners. We exploit the randomness of the lottery to determine if winning the WSER lottery affects the training and travel behavior of lottery winners. We find that WSER lottery winners compete in more races, perform better in these races, and travel more in the short run (1-2 years). However, in the long run, lottery winners compete in fewer events, travel less, and compete in smaller events than lottery losers. This confirms that WSER is a “bucket list” event and extends the literature on the behavior of lottery winners to the context of ultramarathons.</blockquote>
